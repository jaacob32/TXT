<p> I like to take pictures for fun. In high school I would take pictures for sports games and other events. I really gained a passion for taking good quality photos. </p>
<p> I also like to design things. I am interested in graphic design so often I like to challenge myself to design something in photoshop. </p>
<p> I like to play video games. I have been playing video games since I was a little kid so it has always been a fun way for me to destress and have fun. </p>
